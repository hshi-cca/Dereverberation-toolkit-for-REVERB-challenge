>>> This tool is for deep learning-based monaural speech dereverberation. <<<  
>>> We want to make an open source tool for the REVERB CHALLANGE dataset. <<<  

>>> If you find any bugs in this tool, please contact me! Thank you!      <<<

## Models included in this tool:
Frequency-domain
- [x] DNN (Frames-level Loss)
- [ ] LSTM (Frames-level Loss)
- [ ] LSTM (Utterance-level Loss)
- [ ] CNN (Frames-level Loss)
- [ ] CNN (Utterance-level Loss)
- [ ] U-net (Frames-level Loss)
- [ ] U-net (Utterance-level Loss)  

Time-domain
- [ ] SEGAN
- [ ] FCN 
- [ ] Conv-Tasnet 

## Future works
`I will do ti in a few years, but it does not work now!!!`
I will release the first egs in this month! If everything goes well!
