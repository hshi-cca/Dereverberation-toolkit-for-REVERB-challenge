Speech-dereverberation-tools  
====

#### This tool is for deep learning-based monaural speech dereverberation.   
#### We want to make `an open source tool for the REVERB CHALLANGE dataset`. 


## The first network models contain (but noy just):
### Frequency-domain
* DNN (Frames-level)
* LSTM (Frames-level, utterance-level)
* CNN (Frames-level, utterance-level, picture)
* U-net
### Time-domain
* SEGAN
* FCN

*****

## Future works
`I will do ti in a few years, but it does not work now!!!`
I will release the first egs in this month! If everything goes well!
